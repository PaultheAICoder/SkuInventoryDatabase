# Implementation Plan
**Generated**: 2025-12-08T14:30:00Z
**Generated By**: Scout-and-Plan Agent (combined workflow)
**Task ID**: GitHub Issue #213
**Estimated Build Time**: 0.25 hours (15 minutes)
**Complexity**: Low

## Investigation Summary

### Request Analysis
**Type**: Bug Fix
**Source**: GitHub Issue #213
**Priority**: Medium

### Task Classification
**Category**: BUG_FIX
**Test Strategy**: FAST_PATH (smoke tests only)
**Suggested Filter**: None (change is too minimal for targeted tests)

### Issue Validation
**Status**: Valid
**Recent Changes**: Issue #197 (Shopify dead code removal) moved the Orders page to `_deferred/` but failed to remove the navigation link from the dashboard layout.

### Root Cause Analysis

The `/orders` route returns 404 because:

1. **Issue #197** (commit fdb41ef on 2025-12-06) moved all Shopify integration code to `src/_deferred/shopify/` directory for V2
2. This included the Orders page at `src/app/(dashboard)/orders/page.tsx` which was moved to `src/_deferred/shopify/pages/orders/page.tsx`
3. However, the navigation entry in `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` line 41 was **NOT** removed:
   ```tsx
   { name: 'Orders', href: '/orders', icon: ShoppingCart },
   ```
4. This is a simple oversight from the Shopify dead code cleanup

### Current State Assessment
- **Existing components**: Navigation link at line 41 of layout.tsx points to non-existent route
- **Database**: Not affected
- **API Routes**: Orders API routes already moved to `_deferred/`
- **Types**: Not affected

### Dependencies and Blockers
None - this is an isolated fix to remove dead navigation.

**Can Proceed?**: YES

### Complexity Assessment
**Complexity**: Simple
**Effort**: 15 minutes
**Risk**: Low (removing dead code only)

### Patterns Identified
**Primary**: N/A - simple deletion
**Secondary**: N/A

### Ripple Effect Analysis
**Files Identified**: 1

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` | Contains the dead navigation link to remove |

No other active files reference `/orders`. All other references are in `src/_deferred/` which is excluded from compilation.

## Executive Summary

Remove the dead "Orders" navigation link from the dashboard sidebar. The Orders feature was deferred to V2 when Shopify integration code was moved to `src/_deferred/` in issue #197, but the navigation entry was not removed. This is a 2-line fix: remove the navigation entry and the unused `ShoppingCart` icon import.

## Phase 1: Remove Dead Navigation

### Subtask 1.1: Remove Orders Navigation Entry
**File**: `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
**Pattern**: N/A (simple deletion)

**Instructions**:
1. Remove line 41:
   ```tsx
   { name: 'Orders', href: '/orders', icon: ShoppingCart },
   ```

**Code Change**:
```diff
 const navigation = [
   { name: 'Dashboard', href: '/', icon: LayoutDashboard },
   { name: 'Components', href: '/components', icon: Package },
   { name: 'SKUs', href: '/skus', icon: Boxes },
   { name: 'Transactions', href: '/transactions', icon: ArrowLeftRight },
-  { name: 'Orders', href: '/orders', icon: ShoppingCart },
   { name: 'Lots', href: '/lots', icon: Layers },
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] Line 41 removed from navigation array

### Subtask 1.2: Remove Unused ShoppingCart Import
**File**: `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
**Pattern**: N/A (simple deletion)

**Instructions**:
1. Remove `ShoppingCart` from the lucide-react import statement at line 24

**Code Change**:
```diff
 import {
   LayoutDashboard,
   Package,
   Boxes,
   ArrowLeftRight,
   Upload,
   BarChart3,
   Settings,
   Users,
   MapPin,
   LogOut,
   Menu,
   X,
   Layers,
   Building2,
-  ShoppingCart,
   TrendingDown,
   Tag,
   FolderTree,
 } from 'lucide-react'
```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] ShoppingCart removed from import statement

## Phase 2: Validation

### Subtask 2.1: Verify Build and Types
**Instructions**:
1. Run TypeScript check:
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```
2. Run build:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
3. Run lint:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] TypeScript compiles with 0 errors
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Lint passes with no errors/warnings

### Subtask 2.2: Manual Verification (Optional)
**Instructions**:
1. Start the test app if not running
2. Navigate to http://172.16.20.50:2345
3. Verify sidebar no longer shows "Orders" link
4. Verify no 404 errors when using the app normally

**Completion Criteria**:
- [ ] "Orders" no longer appears in sidebar navigation
- [ ] All other navigation links work correctly

## Summary of Deliverables
**Files Created**: 0
**Files Modified**: 1
- `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` (2 changes)

## Handoff to Build Agent
1. Execute subtasks 1.1 and 1.2 (both in layout.tsx)
2. Run validation commands in subtask 2.1
3. Manual verification in 2.2 is optional but recommended

## Test Strategy Note
- This is a FAST_PATH change - minimal code removal
- No unit tests needed - this removes dead code
- Visual verification recommended to confirm sidebar updated

## Alternative Considered (NOT RECOMMENDED)

An alternative would be to implement a placeholder Orders page that shows "Coming in V2" similar to how the integrations page was updated in issue #197. However, this is NOT recommended because:

1. It adds unnecessary code that will be replaced in V2
2. The simplest fix is to remove the dead link
3. The Orders feature is part of Shopify integration which is explicitly deferred to V2
4. Users should not be presented with non-functional features
