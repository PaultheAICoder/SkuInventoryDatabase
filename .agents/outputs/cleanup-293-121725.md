## Cleanup Summary

### What Was Accomplished
**Frontend**: 1 file
- `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `expandedTxId` state and `toggleExpand` function
- Added ChevronDown/ChevronRight icons from lucide-react
- Added clickable expander button for multi-line transactions
- Added expanded content row showing all transaction lines
- Updated Change column to show "N items" when expanded

### Deferred Work
**Items Identified**: 0
- All requirements fully implemented
- No Phase 2, Optional, or Future work mentioned in issue

### Future Work Issues Created
None required.

### Pre-existing E2E Test Failures (Not Related to This Feature)
1. `location-management.spec.ts:263` - Location deactivation test mismatch
2. `test-feedback-api.spec.ts:19` - Rate limit hit (429)

These are infrastructure issues unrelated to the dashboard transaction expansion feature.
