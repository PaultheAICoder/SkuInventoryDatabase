## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at completion-docs/2026-01-08-issue-394-fraction-input-component-prices.md
2. Test at http://172.16.20.50:4545/components/new
3. Verify fraction "1/45" is accepted and stored with full precision
4. Consider addressing Issue #406 for consistency across all cost inputs
