## Cleanup Summary

### What Was Accomplished
**Category**: Administrative - False Positive Closure

**Issues Closed**:
- Issue #265: Closed as false positive (user confirmation misinterpreted)
- Issue #269: Closed as duplicate of #265

**Root Cause**: The automated follow-up system incorrectly created issues when user replied "Verified Thanks, Trevor" to confirm issue #257's fix was working. "Verified" was misinterpreted as a complaint rather than the expected positive confirmation.

### Files Changed
**Backend**: 0 files
**Frontend**: 0 files
**Tests**: 0 files
**Total**: 0 files modified

### Deferred Work
**Items Identified**: 1 (out of scope)

**System Improvement Suggestion** (not tracked as issue - external system):
- Auto-follow-up system should recognize positive confirmations
- Add deduplication to prevent multiple issues from same response

### Future Work Issues Created
None - the improvement is for an external email-to-issue system

### Git Commit
**Message**: None (no code changes)
**Files Changed**: 0
**Push Status**: N/A
