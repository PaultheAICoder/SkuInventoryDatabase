**Test Duration**: ~20s (well under 15m limit)

## Technical Summary

### Approach: Reversal + Recreate
The implementation uses a "Reversal + Recreate" approach:
1. Reverse all original transaction line effects (lot balances, finished goods)
2. Delete old transaction lines
3. Create new transaction lines with updated values
4. For builds: recalculate lot consumption and finished goods

### Transaction Types Supported
| Type | Editable Fields |
|------|-----------------|
| Receipt | Date, Component, Quantity, Supplier, Cost/Unit, Location, Notes |
| Adjustment | Date, Component, Type, Quantity, Reason, Location, Notes |
| Initial | Date, Component, Quantity, Cost/Unit, Location, Notes |
| Transfer | Date, Component, Quantity, From Location, To Location, Notes |
| Build | Date, Units to Build, Sales Channel, Defect Count, Defect Notes, Location, Notes |
| Outbound | Date, SKU, Sales Channel, Quantity, Location, Notes |

### Role-Based Access
- Viewer role: Cannot see Edit button (UI), blocked at API level (403)
- All other roles: Can edit approved transactions

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report: `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/completion-docs/2025-12-09-issue-243-transaction-edit.md`
2. Test at http://172.16.20.50:4545
3. Verify Edit button on transaction detail page
4. Test editing different transaction types
