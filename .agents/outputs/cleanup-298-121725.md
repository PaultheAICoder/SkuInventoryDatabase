## Task Classification
**Category**: REFACTORING
**Strategy Applied**: TARGETED (SKU-related validation only)
**Rationale**: Pure refactoring task - routes unchanged, just code organization

## Side Effects Noted
1. Brand filtering now applied on dashboard page (was missing)
2. `finishedGoodsQuantity` now returned on dashboard page (was missing)

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/completion-docs/2025-12-17-issue-298-sku-service-consolidation.md`
2. Test at http://172.16.20.50:4545
3. Decide on next work item
