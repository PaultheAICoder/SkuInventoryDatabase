### Deferred Work
**Items Identified**: 1
- Email parsing improvement for concatenated email threads (documented in completion report)
- This is a minor enhancement, not urgent

## Scope Accuracy Analysis
**Plan Listed Tasks**: 4 phases
**Build Actually Executed**: 4 phases + Phase 0 (env verification)
**Accuracy**: 100%

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. Clear operational task with well-defined phases
2. Build agent correctly identified and corrected email parsing misclassification
3. All database operations executed successfully against production

### What Could Be Improved
1. Email parsing could better handle concatenated email threads

### Similar Bug Patterns Detected
- Email parsing issue may affect future email replies with similar concatenation patterns
- Not critical - documented for future improvement

### Process Improvements Identified
- None - workflow executed smoothly for operational task
