## Existing Feature Summary

### How to Use the Feature

**Building SKUs (Converting Components to Finished Goods)**:
1. Navigate to SKU detail page (`/skus/{skuId}`)
2. Click "Build" button (requires SKU to have an active BOM)
3. Fill in: Date, Units to build, Location, Output location
4. System automatically:
   - Validates component inventory
   - Depletes BOM components from inventory
   - Creates finished goods at output location
   - Records BOM cost on transaction

**Viewing Finished Goods**:
- SKU List (`/skus`): "FG Qty" column
- SKU Detail: "Finished Goods Inventory" section with location breakdown

**Managing Finished Goods**:
- "Adjust FG" button on SKU detail page
- "Receive FG" button on SKU detail page
- Outbound transactions for shipping
