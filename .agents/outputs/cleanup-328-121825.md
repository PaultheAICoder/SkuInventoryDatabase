### E2E Tests
**Status**: SKIPPED due to pre-existing infrastructure issue
**Reason**: Test environment database is disconnected (see `curl http://172.16.20.50:2345/api/health` returns `database: "disconnected"`)
**Impact**: Not related to issue #328 changes - pre-existing infrastructure problem

### Automated Validation
```bash
$ npx tsc --noEmit - PASS
$ npm run build - PASS
$ npm test - 658 unit tests passed
$ npm run test:e2e - SKIPPED (infrastructure issue)
```

## Cleanup Summary

### What Was Accomplished
**Frontend**: 2 files modified
- `src/components/integrations/asin-mapping-modal.tsx` - Extended with manual entry mode (mode prop, manual ASIN input, brand selector, updated submit logic)
- `src/components/integrations/asin-mapping-list.tsx` - Added "Add Mapping" button (admin only), manual modal state and handler

### Deferred Work
**Items Identified**: 0
- No deferred work mentioned in issue
- All acceptance criteria met

### Future Work Issues Created
None required - feature is complete.

### Known Infrastructure Issue (Pre-existing)
- Test environment database is disconnected
