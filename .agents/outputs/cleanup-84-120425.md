**Workflow Status**: COMPLETE

## Validation Summary

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Value | Target |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Tests Run | 498 | varies |
| Tests Passed | 498 | 100% |
| TypeScript Errors | 0 | 0 |
| Build Errors | 0 | 0 |
| **Warnings Fixed** | **0** | **ALL** |
| **Warnings Remaining** | **0** | **0** |

### Blocker Resolutions
No blockers encountered. All validation checks passed on first run.

### Unit Tests Created
**File**: `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/tests/unit/lot-selection.test.ts` (NEW)
**Tests**: 14 tests covering:
- FEFO ordering (earliest expiry first)
- Nulls-to-end sorting
- Multiple lot selection until quantity met
- Error on insufficient quantity
- Partial selection with allowInsufficient
- Mixed lot/pooled component handling
- Manual override validation

### Integration Tests Created
**File**: `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/tests/integration/lot-consumption.test.ts` (NEW)
**Tests**: 5 tests covering:
- FEFO consumption from earliest expiry lot
- Multiple transaction lines from multiple lots
- LotBalance decrement verification
- Backward compatibility with pooled components
- Manual lot override functionality
**Status**: Skipped (requires seeded database)

### E2E Tests
**Status**: Skipped
**Reason**: Production database has no seeded users - pre-existing infrastructure issue not related to Issue #84

### Automated Validation
```bash
$ npx tsc --noEmit - PASS (zero errors)
$ npm run build - PASS (compiled successfully)
$ npm run lint - PASS (zero warnings)
$ npm test - 498 unit tests passed (100%)
$ npm test lot-selection - 14 tests passed
$ npm test build-finished-goods - 13 tests passed
```

## Cleanup Summary

### What Was Accomplished
**Backend**: 3 files
- `src/services/lot-selection.ts` (NEW) - FEFO algorithm service
- `src/services/inventory.ts` - Extended with lot consumption
- `src/app/api/skus/[id]/lot-availability/route.ts` (NEW) - Lot availability API

**Frontend**: 1 file
- `src/components/features/BuildDialog.tsx` - Lot selection UI

**Types**: 1 file
- `src/types/transaction.ts` - LotSelection interfaces

**Tests**: 3 files
- `tests/unit/lot-selection.test.ts` (NEW) - 14 tests
- `tests/integration/lot-consumption.test.ts` (NEW) - 5 tests
- `tests/unit/build-finished-goods.test.ts` - Updated mocks

**Total**: 4 files created, 4 files modified

### Deferred Work
**Items Identified**: 3
- Already tracked: Issue #91 (Expiry enforcement)
- Already tracked: Issue #88 (Recall tracing)
- Full manual lot selection UI noted in code as future enhancement

### Future Work Issues Created

### Git Commit
**Message**: feat(issue #84): implement FEFO lot selection for build consumption
**Files Changed**: 8
**Push Status**: Pending

## Next Steps
1. Review completion report at `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/completion-docs/2025-12-04-issue-84-lot-consumption-fefo.md`
2. Test at http://172.16.20.50:4545 (requires seeding database with test data first)
3. Consider setting up database seed automation for E2E tests
4. Decide on next work item

## Performance Summary
