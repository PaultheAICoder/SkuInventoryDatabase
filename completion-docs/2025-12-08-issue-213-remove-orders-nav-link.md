# Task #213 - Remove Dead Orders Navigation Link - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## Executive Summary
Successfully removed the dead "Orders" navigation link from the dashboard sidebar. This was a follow-up fix for an oversight in Issue #197 (Shopify dead code removal) where the navigation entry was not removed when the Orders page was deferred to V2.

## What Was Accomplished
**Frontend**: 1 file
- `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` - Removed Orders nav entry and unused ShoppingCart import

**Tests**: 0 new tests (not needed for dead code removal)

## Validation Results

### Pre-flight
- TypeScript: PASS (0 errors)
- Build: PASS (73/73 static pages generated)
- Lint: PASS (0 errors/warnings)

### Test Execution
- Unit Tests Run: 595
- Unit Tests Passed: 595
- Unit Tests Skipped: 5
- Test Duration: 18.68s

### E2E Testing
- E2E Tests Run: 223
- E2E Tests Passed: 204
- E2E Tests Skipped: 11
- E2E Tests Failed: 8 (pre-existing infrastructure issue - see below)
- Visual Verification: COMPLETE (sidebar no longer shows Orders link)

### Pre-existing E2E Issue Discovered
All 8 failing tests are in `company-brand-selector.spec.ts` - unrelated to Issue #213.
Created tracking issue: **Issue #221** - E2E Test Infrastructure: Company Brand Selector tests failing

### Issues Fixed During Validation
None - Build agent work was complete and correct.

### Warnings Fixed
- 0 warnings (none present)

## Deferred Work Verification
**Deferred Items**: 0
- The Orders feature is intentionally deferred to V2 as part of Shopify integration (tracked in Issue #197 scope)
- No new deferred work from this issue

## Known Limitations & Future Work
- Orders functionality will be implemented in V2 with Shopify integration
- Pre-existing E2E test failures in company-brand-selector tracked in Issue #221

## Scope Accuracy Analysis
**Plan Listed Files**: 1
**Build Actually Modified**: 1
**Accuracy**: 100%

## Lessons Learned (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. Simple, surgical fix with no side effects
2. Build agent completed work cleanly with all validations passing
3. Fast turnaround for a straightforward bug fix

### What Could Be Improved
1. Issue #197 should have included navigation cleanup in its scope
2. E2E tests for company-brand-selector need attention (tracked in #221)

### Similar Bug Patterns Detected (CHECK THIS)
**Did the bug fixed in this issue exist in other files?**
- NO - The Orders navigation link was the only dead link in the navigation array
- Verified all other navigation entries point to existing routes

### Process Improvements Identified
- [x] When removing features, checklist should include "Remove navigation links"
- Suggestion: Add pre-commit hook to detect routes referenced in navigation that don't exist
