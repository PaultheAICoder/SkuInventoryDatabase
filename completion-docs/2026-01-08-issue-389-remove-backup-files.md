# Task #389 - Remove Backup Files from Codebase - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## What Was Accomplished
**Files Deleted**: 2
- `src/components/features/BrandSelector.tsx.bak` (2567 bytes)
- `src/components/features/CompanySelector.tsx.bak` (2621 bytes)

**Files Modified**: 1
- `.gitignore` - Added `*.bak` pattern in Misc section

**Accuracy**: 100%

## Lessons Learned (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. Simple cleanup task executed efficiently with minimal overhead
2. Build agent correctly identified and removed all `.bak` files
3. FAST_PATH strategy appropriate - no unnecessary test execution

### What Could Be Improved
1. These backup files should have been caught in the original PR that created them (Dec 2024)
2. Consider adding `*.bak` to `.gitignore` templates for new projects

### Similar Bug Patterns Detected
**Did the bug fixed in this issue exist in other files?**
- No - only 2 `.bak` files existed in the repository

### Process Improvements Identified
- [ ] None - workflow executed efficiently
