# Task #335 - Shopify Orders "Unmapped" Messaging - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## Executive Summary
Updated user-facing text in the Shopify order review UI to replace the confusing term "unmapped" with clearer messaging that explains users need to link Shopify products to internal SKUs. This is a pure UX improvement with no logic changes.

**Key Metrics:**
- Files Modified: 2
- Text Changes: 4
- Tests Run: 666 (all passed)
- Warnings Fixed: 0 (none present)
- Build Status: PASS

## What Was Accomplished

### API/Backend: 0 files
No backend changes - this was a UI-only text update.

### Frontend: 2 files

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/components/features/OrderReviewTable.tsx` | 2 text string updates |
| `src/components/features/OrderDetail.tsx` | 2 text string updates |

### Text Changes Summary

| Location | Original Text | New Text |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Filter dropdown (OrderReviewTable line 47) | "Has Unmapped" | "Needs SKU Link" |
| Table cell (OrderReviewTable line 188) | "{count} unmapped" | "{count} needs SKU link" |
| Badge (OrderDetail line 107) | "Unmapped" | "No SKU" |
| Warning banner (OrderDetail lines 190-191) | "This order has unmapped line items. Map all items before approving." | "Some products aren't linked to internal SKUs. Link all items before approving." |

## Validation Results

### Pre-flight
- TypeScript: PASS (zero errors)
- Build: PASS (102/102 static pages)
- Lint: PASS (zero errors/warnings)

### Test Execution
- Tests Run: 671 (666 passed, 5 skipped)
- Test Duration: 39s
- Skipped Tests: 5 (auth-validation tests - expected)

### E2E Testing
- Not required for this issue (text-only changes, no logic modifications)
- Docker containers verified healthy

### Issues Fixed During Validation
None - Build agent's work was complete and correct.

### Warnings Fixed
- 0 warnings fixed (none were present)

## Deferred Work Verification
**Deferred Items**: 0

No deferred items in the original issue. The internal type value `'unmapped'` in `src/types/shopify-sync.ts` was intentionally NOT changed as it is a code/data identifier used in database queries, API responses, and component logic (not user-facing text).

## Known Limitations & Future Work
None identified. This issue is fully complete.

## Workflow Performance
| Phase | Duration | Target |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Pre-flight | 1m | <2m |
| Build verification | 2m | <5m |
| Test Execution | 1m | <15m |
| Issue Fixes | 0m | varies |
| Cleanup | 2m | <10m |
| **Total** | **6m** | |

## Scope Accuracy Analysis
**Plan Listed Files**: 2
**Build Actually Modified**: 2
**Accuracy**: 100%

## Lessons Learned (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. Simple scope - text-only changes made this a fast, low-risk fix
2. Plan accurately identified all 4 text locations that needed updating
3. Build agent correctly preserved the internal `'unmapped'` type value

### What Could Be Improved
1. Consider adding a UX review step for terminology in future features to catch confusing terms before release

### Similar Bug Patterns Detected (CHECK THIS)
**Did the bug fixed in this issue exist in other files?**
- No - the "unmapped" terminology was specific to the Shopify order review UI
- The `_deferred/` folder contains backup copies that were correctly NOT modified

### Process Improvements Identified
- None required - workflow executed efficiently for this simple scope
