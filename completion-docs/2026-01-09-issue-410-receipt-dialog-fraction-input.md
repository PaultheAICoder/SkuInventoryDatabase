# Task #410 - Apply Fraction Input Support to ReceiptDialog.tsx Cost Field - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated**: 2026-01-09T11:48:00-08:00
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## Executive Summary
Successfully applied fraction input support to the ReceiptDialog.tsx cost field, following the established pattern from issues #394 and #406. This is a simple UI enhancement that enables users to enter fractional costs like "1/45" in addition to decimal values.

## What Was Accomplished
**API/Backend**: 0 files (no changes needed)
**Frontend**: 1 file modified
**Tests**: 803 tests, all passing

### Files Modified
- `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/src/components/features/ReceiptDialog.tsx` - 4 insertions, 6 deletions

### Changes Made
1. **Import Statement** (Line 23): Added `parseFractionOrNumber` to import from `@/lib/utils`
2. **Cost Parsing Logic** (Line 133): Replaced `parseFloat()` with `parseFractionOrNumber() ?? undefined`
3. **Cost Input Field** (Lines 309-318): Changed from `type="number"` to `type="text"`, removed `step` and `min` attributes, updated placeholder to `"e.g., 0.02, 1/45 (blank = N/A)"`

## Validation Results

### Pre-flight
- TypeScript: PASS (no errors)
- Build: PASS (compiled successfully)
- Lint: PASS (no errors or warnings)

### Test Execution
- Tests Run: 803
- Tests Passed: 803
- Tests Skipped: 5 (auth validation - expected)
- Test Duration: 39s

### E2E Testing
- Skipped: This is a simple UI enhancement using a well-tested utility function
- The `parseFractionOrNumber` function is already covered by existing tests

### Issues Fixed During Validation
- None - Build agent's implementation was correct

### Warnings Fixed
- 0 warnings (none present)

## Scope Accuracy Analysis
**Plan Listed Files**: 1
**Build Actually Modified**: 1
**Accuracy**: 100%

## Lessons Learned (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. Build agent followed the established pattern from #394 and #406 exactly
2. No validation issues - implementation was clean and correct
3. Fast turnaround due to simple, well-defined change

### What Could Be Improved
1. None identified - this was a textbook quick fix

### Similar Bug Patterns Detected
**Did the bug fixed in this issue exist in other files?**
- Checked: No other files using `type="number"` for cost inputs that need fraction support remain
- The pattern has now been applied to: ComponentForm.tsx (#394), QuickEntryForm.tsx (#406), FinishedGoodsReceiptDialog.tsx (#406), and ReceiptDialog.tsx (#410)

### Process Improvements Identified
- None - workflow executed efficiently
