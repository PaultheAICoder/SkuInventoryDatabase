# Task #406 - Apply Fraction Input Support - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## Executive Summary
Added fraction input support (e.g., "1/45") to cost fields in QuickEntryForm and FinishedGoodsReceiptDialog, following the pattern established in issue #394 for ComponentForm. This allows users to enter costs as fractions instead of calculating decimals manually.

## What Was Accomplished
**Frontend**: 2 files modified
- `src/components/features/QuickEntryForm.tsx` - import, input attributes, payload parsing (2 locations)
- `src/components/features/FinishedGoodsReceiptDialog.tsx` - import, input attributes, payload parsing (1 location)

**Tests**: 803 tests, all passing

## Validation Results

### Pre-flight
- TypeScript: PASS
- Build: PASS
- Lint: PASS

### Test Execution
- Tests Run: 803
- Tests Passed: 803
- Test Duration: 39s

### E2E Testing
- Skipped (UI changes are input field type changes, not visual layout changes)

### Issues Fixed During Validation
None required - Build agent's work was complete and correct.

### Warnings Fixed
- 0 warnings found during validation

## Deferred Work Verification
**Deferred Items**: 1
- CREATED: Issue #410 - Apply fraction input support to ReceiptDialog.tsx

## Known Limitations & Future Work
- ReceiptDialog.tsx still uses `type="number"` and `parseFloat()` for cost field (tracked in #410)

## Workflow Performance
| Phase | Duration | Target |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Pre-flight | 2m | <2m |
| Test Execution | 1m | <15m |
| Issue Fixes | 0m | varies |
| Cleanup | 3m | <10m |
| **Total** | **17m** | |

## Scope Accuracy Analysis
**Plan Listed Files**: 2
**Build Actually Modified**: 2
**Accuracy**: 100%

## Lessons Learned (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. Build agent followed the pattern established in #394 exactly
2. All validation passed on first attempt
3. Follow-up issue identified and created for remaining file

### What Could Be Improved
1. Plan could have included all files with the same pattern (ReceiptDialog.tsx) for a single comprehensive fix

### Similar Bug Patterns Detected
**Did the bug fixed in this issue exist in other files?**
- YES: ReceiptDialog.tsx has the same pattern
- Created follow-up issue #410 for this file

### Process Improvements Identified
- [ ] Scout-and-Plan agent could do more thorough pattern scanning to find ALL files with similar issues in the initial plan
