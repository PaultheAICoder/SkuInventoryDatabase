# Task #300 - Refactor Bloated SKU API Handler - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## Executive Summary
Successfully extracted the bloated POST handler logic (~230 lines) from `src/app/api/skus/route.ts` into a clean `createSku()` service function in `src/services/sku.ts`. The API route handler is now ~108 lines - a 53% reduction. Pure refactoring with no behavioral changes.

## What Was Accomplished
**API/Backend**: 2 files modified
- `src/services/sku.ts` - Added `CreateSkuParams`, `CreateSkuResult` interfaces and `createSku()` function (+195 lines)
- `src/app/api/skus/route.ts` - Slimmed down POST handler to use service (-126 lines)

**Tests**: 641 unit tests + 8 integration tests passed
