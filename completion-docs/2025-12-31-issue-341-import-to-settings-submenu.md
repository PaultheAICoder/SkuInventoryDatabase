# Task #341 - Move Import to Settings Sub-menu - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## Executive Summary

Simple UI refactoring task that moved the "Import" navigation item from the main sidebar to the Settings sub-menu. This reduces clutter in the main navigation while grouping administrative functions together.

**Key Metrics**:
- Files Modified: 1
- Tests Run: 666
- Tests Passed: 666
- Warnings: 0
- Build Status: SUCCESS

## What Was Accomplished

**Frontend**: 1 file modified
- `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`
  - Removed Import from `mainNavigation` array (line 50)
  - Added Import to `settingsNavigation` array after "General" (line 60)
  - The Upload icon import was already present (line 14) and remains unchanged

**Navigation Change**:
- Before: Import appeared in main sidebar as standalone item
- After: Import appears under Settings sub-menu

**Auto-Expand Logic**: The existing `useEffect` hook (lines 81-88) automatically handles expanding the Settings menu when navigating to `/import`, requiring no code changes.

**Accuracy**: 100%

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. Simple, well-scoped task with clear acceptance criteria
2. Existing auto-expand logic handled the new path automatically
3. Build agent correctly identified that no new code was needed for Settings auto-expansion
4. Docker container rebuild was straightforward

### What Could Be Improved
1. Could have E2E tests for navigation structure changes to verify menu placement

### Similar Bug Patterns Detected
Not applicable - this was a feature enhancement, not a bug fix.

### Process Improvements Identified
- [ ] Consider adding E2E test for Settings sub-menu navigation structure
