# Task #232 - Finished Goods Category - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)
**Date**: 2025-12-09

## Executive Summary

GitHub Issue #232 requested a "Finished Goods Category" feature to:
1. Use components to create SKUs
2. Deplete component inventory during builds
3. Track finished goods inventory separately

**Outcome**: The requested feature is **already fully implemented** in the codebase. No code changes were required. Issue closed with detailed usage instructions.

## What Was Accomplished

**Type**: VERIFICATION (No Code Changes)

The 3-agent workflow performed a comprehensive verification:
- Scout-and-Plan Agent: Investigated codebase, discovered feature exists
- Build Agent: Verified all components exist and function correctly
- Test-and-Cleanup Agent: Validated tests pass, closed issue with documentation

- Lint: PASS (zero errors/warnings)

### Test Execution
- Tests Run: 34
- Tests Passed: 34
- Test Duration: 1.27s
- Test Files:
  - `tests/unit/finished-goods-service.test.ts` (21 tests)
  - `tests/unit/build-finished-goods.test.ts` (13 tests)

### Issues Fixed During Validation
None - no code changes required.

### Warnings Fixed
None - codebase was already clean.

## GitHub Issue Resolution

**Issue #232**: Closed with detailed usage instructions including:
1. How to build SKUs (converting components to finished goods)
2. How to view finished goods inventory (SKU list and detail pages)
3. How to manage finished goods (adjust, receive, ship)
4. Technical details about the implementation

## Deferred Work Verification

**Deferred Items**: 0

No deferred work identified. The feature request was fully satisfied by existing implementation.

## Known Limitations & Future Work

None identified. The user may benefit from:
- Additional documentation/help text in the UI
- Training on using the existing feature
- A dedicated "Finished Goods" navigation item (optional enhancement)

## Workflow Performance

| Phase | Duration | Target |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Scout-and-Plan | 3m 24s | varies |
| Build (Verification) | 5m 6s | varies |
| Test-and-Cleanup | ~3m | <10m |
| **Total** | **~12m** | |

## Scope Accuracy Analysis

**Plan Listed Files**: 0 (no changes needed)
**Build Actually Modified**: 0 (verification only)
**Accuracy**: N/A - correct identification of already-implemented feature

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. Scout-and-Plan agent correctly identified the feature already exists
2. Build agent performed thorough verification with tests and Docker rebuild
3. Quick resolution for user - closed with helpful documentation

### What Could Be Improved
1. User education on existing features could prevent similar requests
2. Feature discoverability in UI could be enhanced (tooltips, help text)

### Similar Bug Patterns Detected
N/A - No bug was involved.

### Process Improvements Identified
- [ ] Consider adding feature documentation/help system in the UI
- [ ] Add "Finished Goods" to prominent navigation for discoverability

## User Guide (Included in Issue Closure)

### Building SKUs (Converting Components to Finished Goods)
1. Navigate to SKU detail page (`/skus/{skuId}`)
2. Click "Build" button (requires active BOM)
3. Fill in: Date, Units, Location, Output To, Output Qty
4. System automatically depletes components and creates FG inventory

### Viewing Finished Goods Inventory
- SKU List Page (`/skus`): Shows "FG Qty" column
- SKU Detail Page: Shows "Finished Goods Inventory" section by location

### Managing Finished Goods
- "Adjust FG" button on SKU detail page
- "Receive FG" button on SKU detail page
- Outbound transactions for shipping
