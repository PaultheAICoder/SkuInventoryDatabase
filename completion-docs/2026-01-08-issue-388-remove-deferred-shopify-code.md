# Task #388 - Remove Deferred Shopify Code - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## Executive Summary
Removed obsolete `src/_deferred/` directory containing 37 files of legacy Shopify implementation code. This was a pure cleanup task with no functional changes - the code was already excluded from TypeScript compilation via tsconfig.json and had no imports from the active codebase. The active Shopify integration (Issues #363, #364) has completely superseded all deferred code.

## What Was Accomplished
**Files Deleted**: 37 files
- 3 README files
- 3 services (order-posting.ts, shopify-sync.ts, shopify.ts)
- 6 types (channel-mapping.ts, order-posting.ts, order-review.ts, shopify-connection.ts, shopify-sync.ts, shopify.ts)
- 6 components (LineMappingDialog.tsx, OrderDetail.tsx, OrderReviewTable.tsx, ShopifyConnectionForm.tsx, SkuMappingForm.tsx, SkuMappingTable.tsx)
- 13 API routes (connection, mappings, orders CRUD operations, sync)
- 4 pages (orders, order detail, settings/shopify, settings/mappings)
- 2 test files

**Files Modified**: 1 file
- `tsconfig.json` - removed `src/_deferred` from exclude array

## Lessons Learned (REQUIRED)

### What Went Well
1. FAST_PATH classification was appropriate - pure cleanup with no functional changes
2. Build agent followed plan precisely - 100% scope accuracy
3. Zero warnings achieved on first validation pass

### What Could Be Improved
1. None identified - this was an ideal cleanup workflow execution

### Similar Bug Patterns Detected
