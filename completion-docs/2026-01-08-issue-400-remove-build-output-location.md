# Task #400 - Remove Output Location Settings from Build Transactions - Completion Report
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Generated By**: Test-and-Cleanup Agent (combined workflow)

## Executive Summary
Successfully simplified the Build transaction form by removing the output location and output quantity fields. This aligns with Trevor's preference for keeping builds simple: "If you make it, it's going to stay here. And if it's going to go anywhere, I'm going to record a separate transaction."

**Key Metrics**:
- Files Modified: 1
- Lines Removed: 84
- Lines Added: 21
- Tests: 789 passed, 5 skipped
- Build: PASS
- TypeScript: PASS
- Lint: PASS

## What Was Accomplished

### Frontend Changes
**File**: `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory/src/components/features/BuildDialog.tsx`

1. **Removed from form state**: `outputLocationId` and `outputQuantity` fields
2. **Removed auto-selection logic**: No longer pre-selects first location as output
3. **Removed from API payload**: These values are no longer sent to the backend
4. **Simplified Location Settings UI**: Section now shows only Source Location with helpful guidance text
5. **Removed error handling**: Output location-related error messages removed
6. **Cleaned up unused code**: Removed `EMPTY_VALUE` constant

### No Backend Changes Required
The API route already handles null `outputLocationId` by falling back to the company's default location, so no backend modifications were needed.

## Validation Results

### Pre-flight
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| TypeScript (`npx tsc --noEmit`) | PASS |
| Build (`npm run build`) | PASS |
| Lint (`npm run lint`) | PASS |

### Test Execution
- Test Files: 37 passed, 1 skipped
- Tests Run: 789
- Tests Passed: 789
- Tests Skipped: 5
- Duration: 39.96s

### Docker
- Container Status: healthy
- Rebuild: Not required (pre-built by Build agent)

### Issues Fixed During Validation
None - Build agent's work was clean and complete.

### Warnings Fixed
0 warnings - code was warning-free.

## Deferred Work Verification
