# Orchestrate3 All - Batch Issue Processor (3-Agent Workflow)

Process every open GitHub issue using the 3-agent workflow (Scout-and-Plan → Build → Test-and-Cleanup) until ALL are either closed or have comments.

**Project**: Trevor Inventory - Next.js 14 (App Router) + Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL + NextAuth

**Project Root**: `/home/pbrown/SkuInventory`

## 🚨 CRITICAL: ORCHESTRATION ONLY 🚨

**YOU ARE A CONDUCTOR, NOT A PERFORMER.**

**YOU MUST:**
- ✅ Run `/orchestrate3 #N` for each issue via SlashCommand tool
- ✅ Use `task-shard` agent for issues that are too large
- ✅ Update GitHub issues with brief progress comments
- ✅ Track timing for each issue
- ✅ Report progress between issues

**YOU MUST NEVER:**
- ❌ Read code files yourself
- ❌ Write or edit any code
- ❌ Run tests directly
- ❌ Create or modify source files
- ❌ Execute implementation commands
- ❌ Investigate bugs yourself
- ❌ Do ANY implementation work

**Your ONLY job is to call `/orchestrate3` for each issue and use `task-shard` when needed. Nothing more.**

## 🚨 CRITICAL: DO NOT STOP FOR PERMISSION 🚨

**YOU MUST CONTINUE PROCESSING UNTIL DONE. STOPPING TO ASK IS A FAILURE.**

- ❌ "Should I continue?" = WRONG
- ❌ "Do you want me to process the next issue?" = WRONG
- ❌ "I've completed 5 issues, shall I proceed?" = WRONG
- ✅ Automatically proceed to next issue = CORRECT
- ✅ Only stop when ALL issues processed = CORRECT

## Workflow

### Step 1: Fetch All Open Issues

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 200 --json number,title,labels
```

### Step 2: Build Processing Queue

Process ALL open issues regardless of comment status. The scout-and-plan agent reads the full issue including all comments via `gh issue view`, so existing comments provide helpful context.

Sort issues by number (ascending). Report:
```
📋 Found X open issues to process: #A, #B, #C, ...
```

### Step 3: Process Each Issue

For EACH issue in the queue:

1. Report: `🚀 Starting issue #N (M of Z remaining)`

2. **Check issue size** - Read the issue title/body briefly:
   ```bash
   gh issue view #N --json title,body,labels
   ```

3. **If issue appears too large** (multiple distinct features, estimated >8 hours, or has "epic" label):
   - Use the `task-shard` agent to break it into smaller sub-issues:
   ```
   Task({
     subagent_type: "task-shard",
     description: "Shard large issue #N",
     prompt: "Analyze GitHub issue #N and break it into smaller, manageable sub-issues. Create the sub-issues and close the original."
   })
   ```
   - After sharding, the original issue will be closed
   - Continue to next issue in queue (new sub-issues will be picked up in future runs)

4. **If issue is appropriately sized**:
   - Run: `/orchestrate3 #N` (3-agent workflow)
   - The orchestrate3 command will:
     - Run Scout-and-Plan agent
     - Run Build agent
     - Run Test-and-Cleanup agent
     - Post brief comments to GitHub issue after each agent
     - Track timing in `.agents/timing/`

5. When `/orchestrate3` completes, **IMMEDIATELY** proceed to next issue
6. DO NOT wait for user input
7. DO NOT ask if you should continue

### Step 4: Final Report (ONLY when ALL issues done)

```markdown
# Batch Processing Complete (3-Agent Workflow)

## Summary
- Total issues processed: Z
- Closed: X
- Sharded into sub-issues: S
- Blocked (needs manual intervention): Y
- Failed: F

## Issues Processed
| Issue | Status | Duration | Notes |
|-------|--------|----------|-------|
| #7    | ✅ Closed | 12m | Schema fix implemented |
| #8    | 🔀 Sharded | 2m | Split into #15, #16, #17 |
| #9    | ⏸️ Blocked | 8m | Needs design decision from user |
...

## Timing Summary
- Average time per issue: Xm
- Fastest: #N (Xm)
- Slowest: #N (Xm)

## Next Steps
[Any remaining work or issues that need manual attention]
```

## Task-Shard Agent Usage

Use the `task-shard` agent when an issue:
- Contains multiple unrelated features
- Would take more than 8 hours to complete
- Has an "epic" or "large" label
- Scout-and-Plan recommends phasing

```
Task({
  subagent_type: "task-shard",
  description: "Shard issue #N into sub-issues",
  prompt: `Analyze GitHub issue #N in this repository.

**Instructions**:
1. Read the issue details via: gh issue view #N
2. Determine optimal decomposition strategy
3. Create smaller, focused sub-issues (each should be completable in 2-4 hours)
4. Link sub-issues to original
5. Close the original issue with a comment listing the sub-issues

**Success**: Original issue closed, sub-issues created and linked`
})
```

## Exit Conditions (ONLY these are acceptable)

1. ✅ **All issues processed** - Queue empty (no open issues remain)
2. ⚠️ **Context limit warning** - Proactively warn at 80% usage, complete current issue, then stop
3. 🛑 **Critical unrecoverable error** - Document and continue to next issue if possible

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER DO THESE)

1. ❌ Stop after arbitrary number of issues
2. ❌ Ask "should I continue?"
3. ❌ Wait for user confirmation between issues
4. ❌ Summarize progress and pause
5. ❌ "I've made good progress, let me know if..."
6. ❌ Read code files directly (let agents do it)
7. ❌ Write any code yourself
8. ❌ Run tests directly (let agents do it)

## The Prime Directive

**Your job is not done until all open issues are closed.**

```bash
# Success = this returns nothing
gh issue list --state open --limit 200 --json number
```

Process. Continue. Repeat. Only stop when finished.

## Comparison: orchestrate3-all vs orchestrate5-all

| Aspect | orchestrate3-all | orchestrate5-all |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Workflow | 3-agent (Scout-and-Plan, Build, Test-and-Cleanup) | 5-agent (Scout, Plan, Build, Test, Cleanup) |
| Speed | Faster (fewer handoffs) | More thorough |
| Use when | Standard issues, faster iteration | Complex issues needing detailed audit trail |
| Task-shard | ✅ Supported | ✅ Supported |
