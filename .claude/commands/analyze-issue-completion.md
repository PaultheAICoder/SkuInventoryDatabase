# Analyze Issue Completion Command

Conduct comprehensive investigation of GitHub issues to determine completion status, identify blockers, and take appropriate closure/follow-up actions.

**Project**: Trevor Inventory - Next.js 14 (App Router) + Prisma ORM + PostgreSQL + NextAuth

**Project Root**: `/Users/paulbrown/Desktop/coding-projects/trevor-inventory`

## Usage

```
/analyze-issue-completion [issue-numbers...]
```

**Examples:**
```
/analyze-issue-completion 7
/analyze-issue-completion 7 8 9 10 11
/analyze-issue-completion #7 #8 #9
```

## Investigation Process

For each issue provided, conduct a comprehensive analysis following these steps:

### 1. Current Status Analysis

**GitHub Investigation:**
- Read issue via `gh issue view [number]` to get description, labels, comments, status
- Check issue metadata: assignees, milestones, projects, creation date
- Review all issue comments for status updates, blockers, or completion notes
- Identify linked issues (parent, children, blocking, blocked-by)

**Local Documentation Review:**
- Search `completion-docs/` for completion reports mentioning the issue
- Search `.agents/outputs/` for agent output files related to the issue
- Check git log for commits mentioning the issue number
- Review any related files

**Status Determination:**
- Calculate completion percentage (0-100%)
- Identify current phase: Not Started / In Progress / Blocked / Testing / Complete
- Document blocking issues or dependencies (if any)
- Identify who worked on it last (from git commits or issue comments)

### 2. Implementation Status Review

**Code Changes:**
- Use `git log --grep="#[issue-number]"` to find related commits
- Read modified files to understand what was implemented
- Check if implementation matches issue acceptance criteria
- Identify any TODO comments or incomplete sections

**Test Coverage:**
- Check for test files related to the issue
- Determine test results: Passing / Failing / Not Written
- Review test coverage percentage (if applicable)
- Document any known test failures or gaps

**Quality Assessment:**
- TypeScript compilation status
- Build status
- Linting compliance
- Documentation completeness

### 3. Closure Assessment

**Completion Criteria:**
- Compare implementation against issue acceptance criteria
- Verify all subtasks completed (if issue has checklist)
- Confirm no blocking bugs or regressions
- Validate test coverage adequate

**Closure Decision Matrix:**

| Status | Criteria | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **CLOSE** | 100% complete, all tests passing, no blockers | Close with completion comment |
| **NEEDS_WORK** | 80-99% complete, minor issues remaining | Create follow-up issue(s), close parent |
| **DECOMPOSE** | Large scope, multiple distinct work items | Create phase issues, close parent with links |
| **BLOCKED** | Cannot proceed due to external dependencies | Document blocker, keep open |
| **INCOMPLETE** | <80% complete | Keep open, update with status |

### 4. Deliverables

Save report to: `.claude/reports/issue-analysis-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

### 5. Follow-Up Actions

After creating the report, take appropriate actions for each issue:

#### For Issues Ready to Close (CLOSE)

```bash
gh issue close [number] --comment "✅ **Issue Analysis Complete - Closing**

This issue has been analyzed and determined to be 100% complete.

**Completion Summary:**
[Brief summary of what was accomplished]

**Commits:**
- [commit hash]: [message]

**Tests:** [All passing / N/A]

**Documentation:** [location of completion docs]

Closing as complete. Thank you!"
```

#### For Issues Needing Follow-Up Work (NEEDS_WORK)

1. Create new follow-up issue(s) for remaining work:
```bash
gh issue create --title "[Follow-up #[parent-number]] [specific work description]" --body "## Parent Issue

This is follow-up work from Issue #[parent-number], which has been mostly completed.

## Background
[Context from parent issue]

## Remaining Work
[Specific tasks to complete]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] [criterion 1]
- [ ] [criterion 2]

## Estimated Effort
[hours]

## Related Issues
- Parent: #[parent-number]"
```

2. Comment on parent issue with follow-up link
3. Close parent issue

#### For Issues to Decompose (DECOMPOSE)

1. Create child issues for each work phase
2. Update parent issue with decomposition
3. Close parent issue

#### For Blocked Issues (BLOCKED)

```bash
gh issue comment [number] --body "⚠️ **Issue Analysis - Currently Blocked**

This issue cannot proceed due to the following blocker(s):

**Blocking Issue(s):**
- #[blocking-issue]: [description]

**Analysis:**
[Summary of current state and why it's blocked]

**Next Steps:**
1. Resolve blocking issue #[blocking-issue]
2. [any other preparatory work needed]

Keeping this issue open. Will revisit after blocker is resolved."
```

#### For Incomplete Issues (INCOMPLETE)

```bash
gh issue comment [number] --body "📊 **Issue Analysis - Work In Progress**

**Current Status:** [completion percentage]% complete

**What's Done:**
- ✅ [completed item 1]
- ✅ [completed item 2]

**What's Remaining:**
- ⏳ [remaining item 1]
- ⏳ [remaining item 2]

**Estimated Effort Remaining:** [hours]

**Recommendation:** [specific guidance on next steps]

Keeping this issue open for continued work."
```

## Critical Rules

1. **DO NOT close issues prematurely**: Only close issues that are 100% complete with all acceptance criteria met
2. **DO NOT make assumptions**: If unclear, read the actual code, tests, and documentation
3. **DO provide evidence**: Include commit hashes, file paths, test results in your analysis
4. **DO create follow-up issues**: Better to have small, tracked issues than leave work undocumented
5. **DO update issue comments**: Always comment on issues before closing to document the decision
6. **DO preserve context**: When creating follow-up issues, include sufficient background from parent issue

## Output Format

After completing all follow-up actions, provide a summary to the user:

```markdown
# Issue Completion Analysis Complete

```

## Notes

- This command performs read-only analysis first, then takes write actions (closing issues, creating new issues) based on findings
- Always create the analysis report before taking any GitHub actions
- Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "scout"` for complex investigation work
- This command should be used periodically (weekly/monthly) for issue hygiene
- Prefer decomposition over keeping large issues open indefinitely
